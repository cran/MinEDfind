Description: The nonparametric two-stage Bayesian adaptive design is a novel phase II clinical trial design for finding the minimum effective dose (MinED). This design is motivated by the top priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new drug, which is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. It is used to design single-agent trials.
